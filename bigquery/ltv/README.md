# Lifetime Value (LTV) Analysis Query

Note: Table and project names have been renamed for confidentiality purposes.

## Overview

This SQL query calculates the Lifetime Value (LTV) of users on a weekly cohort basis. It tracks users from their first transaction, aggregates their cumulative spend (service fees), and measures cohort growth metrics like second transaction rates and weekly revenue.

The query also categorizes users by role type ("brand" or "creator"), Instagram follower tiers ("Nano" to "Mega"), and location ("Miami-Dade County" or "Other City").

It outputs metrics such as:

- Total users

- Users with second transactions

- Total and average cumulative LTV

- Second transaction rate

- Weekly cohort revenue
