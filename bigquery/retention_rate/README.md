## Overview

This SQL query measures user retention over time based on app activity events. It analyzes users from their registration date and tracks daily engagement (sessions, total session time) to calculate retention rates.

Users are categorized based on their Instagram follower tiers and city location, and the retention is calculated across cohorts by days since registration.

The output includes:

- Eligible users by day

- Retained users by day

- Number of sessions and total session time for retained users
